# Husky Dog UI 🐶

A simple **HTML + CSS** practice project where I recreated a clean Husky-themed webpage layout.  
This project is purely for **learning and improving frontend basics** like structure, layout, and styling.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project  
I built this project to:

- Practice HTML structuring  
- Understand how CSS layouts work  
- Experiment with styling and positioning

This is not an original design — I learned from online sources and recreated it for educational purposes only.
