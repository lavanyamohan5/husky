# Husky Webpage – HTML & CSS Learning Project 🐶

This project is a small **practice webpage** where I explored how HTML and CSS work together to create a simple UI.  
The code was taken from an online source and I used it only for **learning and understanding** purposes.

## 🌱 What I Learned From the Code

### 1️⃣ Basic HTML Structure  
- How a webpage starts with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.  
- How tags like `<div>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` are used to arrange content.  
- How sections are grouped to build layout blocks.

### 2️⃣ Linking CSS to HTML  
- Learned how external CSS files are connected using `<link rel="stylesheet">`.  
- Understood why separating HTML and CSS makes the code cleaner.

### 3️⃣ CSS Styling Concepts  
From the stylesheet, I explored:

- **Flexbox basics** — arranging items side by side  
- **Padding & margin** — creating spacing around elements  
- **Colors & background** — applying simple color themes  
- **Border-radius** — making shapes and images look smooth  
- **Fonts & text styles** — adjusting size, weight, and alignment  

### 4️⃣ Layout Understanding  
- How containers and inner boxes are used to place content properly.  
- How a clean UI is built using simple positioning and styling.

### 5️⃣ Image Handling  
- How to insert an image (Husky dog). 
- How CSS controls its size, shape, and placement.
